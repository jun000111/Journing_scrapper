## Overview

This project can be seen as an addition/prerequisite to the [Journing](https://github.com/NDH001/Journing) project, which involves gathering information from ctrip.com. The purpose here is to build on that data for personal projects. The focus of this existing effort is to collect three types of data: attractions, restaurants, and shopping centers.

Importantly, users also have the option to tweak the source code to gather the specific data they want. This flexibility allows individuals to gather information that suits their own needs, making the project more versatile and applicable.

The collected data are not provided here, please contact me at zhi_jun23@hotmail.com for the csv files or just collect the data using the steps below.

## Installation

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. run the scrapper_init.ipynb to get the initial cities csv
3. run either sight_scrapper.py or rest_scrapper.py or shopping_scrapper.py
   Optional : tweak any variables or fields in the source code to adjust the scrapping
